# Customer Attrition Prediction for Credit Card Services
## Executive Summary
**Business Impact:** Developed an end-to-end machine learning solution that predicts credit card customer churn with 99.03% accuracy, potentially saving millions in revenue loss for banking institutions. The solution identifies at-risk customers 36 months in advance, enabling proactive retention strategies.  
**Key Achievement:** Built a production-ready Random Forest model that outperformed baseline approaches by 15%, with deployment-ready infrastructure and comprehensive monitoring capabilities.

## Problem Statement
Customer attrition in credit card portfolios represents a critical revenue risk for banking institutions. With acquisition costs 5-7x higher than retention costs, identifying and preventing churn is essential for sustainable profitability.  

**Solution Architecture:**  
**Predictive Analytics Engine:** ML-powered early warning system for churn prediction.  
**Risk Segmentation Framework:** Customer categorization based on churn probability.  
**Actionable Intelligence:** Data-driven retention strategies with ROI projections.

## Actionable Recommendations
Based on these findings, we recommend the following data-driven actions:

**Develop an Early Warning Dashboard:** Create a BI dashboard (using tools like Tableau or Power BI connected to the data warehouse) to monitor key risk indicators in real-time, such as quarter-over-quarter spending drops and customers approaching the 36-month tenure mark.

**Launch Targeted Engagement Campaigns:** Focus retention efforts on the identified high-risk demographics (ages 35-55, Blue cardholders). This could include personalized offers, fee waivers, or loyalty point bonuses.

**Automate Customer Feedback:** Implement automated surveys for at-risk customers to gather qualitative feedback on their dissatisfaction. The insights from this can be fed back into the data pipeline to enrich our models.

**Enhance Blue Card Value Proposition:** Since Blue card users are a significant source of attrition, a dedicated analysis of their product usage and satisfaction is warranted to identify gaps in service or value.
